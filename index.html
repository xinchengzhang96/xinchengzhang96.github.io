           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p>I am a 6th year math PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Toronto, supervised by Jeremy Quastel. Previously, I was an undergraduate at the University of Toronto. I am interested in probability. I also like running and weightlifting.</p>

           <h2>Research</h2>
           <p>I am interested in solvable models in probability, in particular, models in the KPZ universality class like the totally asymmetric exclusion process and the exponential last passage percolation models. I am also interested in their common limiting object, the KPZ fixed point. One particular focus of my recent work is to understand the KPZ fixed point from a PDE perspective. </p>
